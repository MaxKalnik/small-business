          | One of the fastest growing metropolitan areas, with its population projected to grow 1.65 percent per year, Denver is an attractive location for individuals and businesses alike. Colorado, moreover, has attracted substantial venture capital investment, with 128 deals worth a total of $670,000,000 made between 2010 and 2016.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | While real estate in Colorado is among the most expensive in the country, housing costs in the Denver metropolitan region are quite affordable, with median rents just above $1,000 per month. Office space in the Denver area is inexpensive and plentiful, with an average rent of $13.74 per square foot, and 12.5 percent of all available office spaces are vacant and available. Prices are increasing, and the vacancy rate is decreasing, which reflects a thriving economy, as does its low unemployment rate of 2.9 percent.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | Denver has one of the highest rates of business ownership in the country, and while startups currently make up a smaller proportion of all businesses in the region, their numbers are growing at a healthy rate (79th percentile). In short, get in on the ground floor here while you can.

          | Our second place pick, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts, metropolitan region, is an obvious choice for startups. So obvious, indeed, that one would think Boston should be yesterday’s news in terms of its favorability to small businesses and startups. In fact, the opposite is true: the Boston metro area ranks in the 87th percentile for startup growth and number of startup companies (only 1.7 percent of all businesses are startups).

        p.rankings__item-text
          | While home prices and apartment rents are rather high, office space remains reasonably priced, albeit a little scarce (5 percent vacancy rate). The area also has a highly educated population, with 32.04 percent of residents having a college or graduate degree, and 52.11 percent employed in industries that require a college education. Boston remains an attractive location for founding your business, and with a startup survival rate of 53.97 percent, you are more likely to succeed here than in 98.8 percent of other metro areas.

          | Coming in at third place, the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk metropolitan area in Southwestern Connecticut is a choice that is both natural and counterintuitive. Adjacent to the New York City metropolitan area, it is a smart choice for businesses that require space to grow. While home values and net worths are higher here than anywhere else, office space and housing remains inexpensive for those willing to live and/or work in the city of Bridgeport.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | The region ranks very highly on measures of transit accessibility and frequency, in the 98th percentile for both, and ranks in the 99th percentile for total retail sales. With a high concentration of small businesses (89th percentile), the Bridgeport metro area is a golden opportunity on the Gold Coast of Connecticut.

        | The Twin Cities metropolitan region of Minneapolis-St.Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota, comes in at number four, with strong startup growth figures in the 94th percentile and high rates of business ownership (70th percentile) and startup survival (76th percentile). Household incomes and assets rank in the 80th percentile nationwide, while housing is relatively affordable, which makes your employees wages and your profits go further. Retail sales per business are strong, falling in the 93rd percentile among all metropolitan areas.

          | Fifth place Madison, Wisconsin, owes its place on our list to a combination of several factors. The marketplace for office space is highly favorable to prospective tenants, with a vacancy rate currently in the top 95th percentile, with 14.55 percent of office units not presently occupied. The retail economy in Madison is thriving, with total sales per capita and per business in the 97th percentile, and the Madison region has a very high concentration of small businesses in the 92nd percentile.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | The rate of business ownership in and around Madison is in the 71st percentile. While startup growth is currently sluggish, this will not be the case for long, and those startups that have already chosen Madison have a high survival rate.

          | Like Madison, sixth-place Lincoln, Nebraska, is a college town with highly educated residents. Almost one in four (24.5 percent) of Lincoln area residents hold bachelor's or graduate degrees, while an additional 21.15 percent have either earned an associate’s degree or some amount of college education. With only 39 percent of employment in industries in which education is a prerequisite to getting a job, there is room for growth despite its low overall unemployment rate of 4.1 percent.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | While vacant office space is scarce, at 4.7 percent, rents are very low at $13.30 per square foot. In spite of the fact that the percentage of startups in Lincoln is a low 27th percentile, there are more small businesses than 80 percent of metro areas nationwide and a correspondingly high rate of business ownership. Finally, if there is one reason to choose to start your business in Lincoln, it is the fact that nowhere else has a higher five-year rate of survival for startups than Nebraska.

          | Seventh place Hartford was once known as the capital of the insurance industry in the U.S. (that title now goes to Des Moines, Iowa). Like the Bridgeport metropolitan area, Hartford is a low-income city surrounded by affluent suburbs, and as such presents a similar opportunity.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | Office and apartment rentals are comparably inexpensive, and the available supply outstrips current demand (9.94 percent vacant offices and 7.6 percent vacant housing in the metropolitan area, which includes the surrounding, wealthier suburbs), while businesses have access to a well-educated metro area population for prospective employees and customers.

        | Once an industrial powerhouse, Pittsburgh’s decline was precipitous, and its recent renaissance has been such a meteoric rise that the city has been hailed in the media as the next Seattle. And for good reason — small business density is in the 80th percentile, while startups have a 53.78 percent five-year survival rate. Pittsburgh’s two major universities, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, not only churn out degree-holding graduates, but they are also major area employers and have invested heavily in making Pittsburgh an attractive location for prospective students, professors, and employees.

        | Coming in at ninth place is the Fort Collins, Colorado, metropolitan area, which is the population and business center of Larimer County, between Denver and the Wyoming state line. Like Denver, the Fort Collins metropolitan area is attractive to businesses for its low corporate tax rate of 4.63 percent, as well as a generous job creation tax credit. Business ownership in the Fort Collins metropolitan area is extraordinarily high, in the 98th percentile, and a healthy startup growth rate in the 79th percentile.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | Finally, rounding out our list is the Austin-Round Rock, Texas, metropolitan area. The Austin metropolitan area has a lot going for it, including a population growth rate of 2.67 percent per year between 2010 and 2017, which is projected to continue unabated at a rate of 2.65 percent per year, making it one of the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country (second only to the retirement community of The Villages, Florida). Another college town, Austin is home to an educated population (44.88 percent of area residents have at least some college education) to serve as a pool of prospective employees.

        p.rankings__item-text
          | Not surprisingly, startup growth in the Austin area is in the 89th percentile, and the five-year survival rate for startups is likewise quite high, in the 92nd percentile. Austin also benefits from Texas’ business-friendly lack of a corporate income tax. The only significant drawback to Austin is sky-high office space rental prices, which at an average $22.97 per square foot, are higher than the average for the New York metropolitan area.
